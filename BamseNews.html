            <p>This documentary gives an overview of Bamse’s story and how he sails on the KNM Thorodd from Norway to
                Montrose with Captain Hafto,
                to escort King Haakon to Great Britain and his continued adventures when he arrives.</p>

            <p>Bamse is celebrated for saving the lives of two Norwegian sailors, stationed in Montrose and Dundee
                during World War Two. These acts of bravery earned him a PDSA gold medal, the animal equivalent of the
                George Cross. On his visit to Montrose, Fred discovers more about Bamse from St Bernard lovers, meets a
                woman who remembers him fondly from her childhood, and spends some quality time with the dogs
                themselves.
                </br></br>
                This year marks the 70th anniversary of Bamse’s death and the town of Montrose is preparing to pay their
                respects and celebrate his achievements. The Norwegian Navy will dock in Montrose for the final time on
                21 July to join the town in their celebrations, with a parade of sea cadets, bagpipers and St Bernards.

            <p>Here is an article about Bamse and his adventures featuring a visit to Scotland by a vessel from the
                Nowegian Navy.
                </br></br>
                In 2014, the Norwegian navy visited Scotland to mark the 70th anniversary of the death of heroic Second
                World War sea dog Bamse. The St Bernard was bought in Oslo in 1937 by Captain Erling Hafto and was taken
                to sea aboard the whale catcher Thorodd. When the Second World War broke out, the vessel was drafted
                into the Royal Norwegian Navy and Bamse became an official member of the crew.

                    <p><b>Anna Mandell was inspired to write a children’s book about Bamse after a visit to
                            Montrose.</b></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A CHILDREN’S book celebrating the life of SecondWorldWar sea dog Bamse has set sail for the
                    bookshelves
                    this week.</br></br>

                    Bamse became famous more than 70 years ago as a crew member of the Norwegian Navy who would
                    regularly
                    take part in football matches, round up sailors from local pubs at the end of the day and is even
                    credited with stopping bar fights and a knife attack at Dundee docks.</br></br>

                    On a visit to Montrose two years ago, hosted by author and historianAndrew Orr, Anna Mandell was so
                    struck by the brave St Bernard’s story that she decided to write a book about him.</br></br>

                    She said: “What enchanted me was when the sailors went to the pub, Bamse would know when they should
                    be
                    back on board.</br></br>

                    “He would get on the bus and go and get them out of the pub and take them back to ship. In the end,
                    because he made a nuisance of himself on these buses, he got his own bus pass.</br></br>

                    “The idea was he was more of a comfort but he saved a sailor from the water and another from being
                    attacked so he was very brave.</br></br>

                    “When he died at Montrose the feeling for him was so great he got his own grave.”</br></br>

                    She added: “I have ideas for the second book already.”</br></br>

                    Husband Peter commissioned artist Richard Maby to do a cartoon for her after their visit and they
                    decided to turn the idea into a full-size children’s picture book.</br></br>

                    Peter said: “The art style is very reminiscent of period classics like the Adventures of Tintin, or
                    some
                    of DC Thomson’s comics.”</br></br>

                    Anna invented some new adventures for Bamse for her book and Richard came up with the detailed
                    pictures.</br></br>

                    Every image shows Bamse wearing a hat as he had a particular love of headwear.</br></br>

                    Anna, who spent years designing and making fancy dress outfits in her home village of Moulton Chapel
                    in
                    Lincolnshire, even planted the 17-acre Bamse’s Wood in the Lake District to offset the ecological
                    impact
                    of printing her book.</br></br>

                    The first orders are now with Amazon’s Fife distribution centre and copies are also available
                    throughWaterstone’s and all good bookshops. Bamse was born in 1937 and lived with the Hafto family
                    in
                    Honningsvag, Norway.</br></br>

                    In 1940, during the Nazi invasion of Norway, he became a crew member of the KNM Thorodd, a ship that
                    was
                    part of the flotilla alongside HMS Devonshire, which carried King Haakon to Britain.</br></br>

                    Bamse and his fellow crew members initially arrived in Lerwick but were then transferred to Port
                    Edgar
                    in the Firth of Forth, where the KNM Thorodd was converted for minesweeping duties.</br></br>

                    With the conversion complete, the KNM Thorodd regularly put out to sea to carry out its dangerous
                    tasks.</br></br>

                    Dundee and Montrose became the regular home ports of the ship and its crew.</br></br>

                    In both places Bamse became known for his brave deeds and brought companionship to all he came into
                    contact with.</br></br>

                    Ultimately Bamse was adopted as the mascot for all of the Norwegian forces.</br></br>

                    A statue of the dog was unveiled in Montrose by Prince Andrew in 2006.</br></br>

                    Some 70 years on, the Norwegian Navy still sends dignitaries to the beloved dog’s grave on the
                    anniversary of his death.</br></br>
